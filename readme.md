# Doge

## Button

I used the "input" tag to make the button because, for some reasons, my functions were not working with the "button tag".

## Instructions

I used the same function for all of the instructions (getElementById) and changed the IDs + if/else for the last one.

## Mistakes

I misunderstood the guideline that we should make the exercise only on Friday and started it almost immediately. I found the right function on the internet (I struggled a lot to find it!) but haven't had much time to have a good overview of Javascript. But I'm catching up.
